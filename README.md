# PPO prereasoner
The PPO prereasoner uses OntoPilot to take input files containing triples generated directly from raw plant phenology data and output triples generated by running a reasoner over the data, in combination with the Plant Phenology Ontology, and adding full type (class assertion) information to all class instances.

# Key directories

## Incoming
This directory holds incoming turtle files with instance data that have been generated using PPO/PO terms with raw plant phenology data.  The working input file should be named `unreasoned_data.ttl`.

## Outgoing
This directory receives the pre-reasoned instance data in OWL format.

# How to generate prereasoned output data.

1. Place the input data in the `Incoming` directory.
1. From the main project directory, run:
```
$ ontopilot inference_pipeline -i Incoming/data_file.ttl -o Outgoing/output_data.owl`
```

That's it!
